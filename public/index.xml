      <description>Life 3.0, Being human in the age of AI   Life 3.0 by Max Tegmark &amp;ndash; Life 3.0 At Amazon
  First book on AI Personally, this was the first time reading a book about AI. And as a tech-savvy sysadmin who loves video games, sci-fi and great stories, it got me hooked.
It’s author, Max Tegmark, got me very interested in the subject and he does so by being naturally curious, super-nerdy in a fun way, and just all-round knowledgeable in tech, he’s a professor after all!</description>

      <description>LOTR: The Fellowship of the Ring &amp;ndash; At Amazon
  Ring to rule them all, one Ring to find them One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them Sometimes when I read books, I get a feeling to just read faster, not pay attention to detail, to get to the point of the story. While reading Lord of the rings, I forgot about that feeling completely.</description>

      <description>The Hobbit &amp;ndash; At Amazon
  &amp;ldquo;A timeless advanture for all ages&amp;rdquo; This book was surprisingly easy to read, and it’s in my opinion light-years better than the movies. I read the entire book in Swedish, and although it’s only been a year since I read it, I already have an urge to re-read the whole book in English. The translations just don’t cut it for someone who’s interested in the lore of middle earth.</description>
