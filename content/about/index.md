# What does "Ehmiiz" mean?
Ehmiiz is just my (emils) online name!

# Who's Emil?
I'm a 28 year old guy who's writing this blog mostly to see how blogs can be built, but also to share some of my recent book-reads. I will be reading techy books, but also some classics, starting with the LOTR books since I love the movies so much!

For a living, I work with computer systems and IT automation. It currently involves building and maintaining autentication systems, securing and supporting digital identitys within the company, and a bit of coding.

Most of my free time is spent with my soon-to-be wife and mother of our soon-to-be-son! And my lovly dog, and reading books, ofcourse!

# Why books?
Reading books has not always been a passion of mine, but I'm trying to improve my reading phase in both Swedish and English, so I read books in both the languages currently, and this blog is mostly for the sake of making a blog and remembering the books! I also find it helpful to dig into new technologies by reading a book about them.

# Expectations
I'm not expecting anyone to read this blog, really, but I'm happy that you've read this far if you're still here. Please feel free to send me book recommendations, or just say hello, from the Contact page.

# Goals of this blog
* Simplicity
* Easy to read
* Keep track of my reads in a fun way
* Share some information about myself
